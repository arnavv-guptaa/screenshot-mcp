## Usage Guide for AI Agents

### Basic Screenshot
Simply provide the URL to capture:
```
@https://example.com
Can you take a screenshot of this page?
```

### Authentication Required
For protected pages, provide credentials:
```
@https://app.example.com/dashboard
Can you capture this page? Here are the credentials:
username: user@example.com
password: pass123
```

### Dynamic Content
The tool automatically:
- Waits for content to load
- Detects and captures tabs
- Handles lazy-loaded content
- Ensures charts and data are rendered

Example:
```
@https://app.example.com/analytics
Can you capture all tabs in the analytics dashboard?
```

### Element Specific
Capture specific components:
```
@https://example.com/pricing
Can you capture just the pricing table?
```

## Best Practices for Users

1. **Authentication**
   - Provide credentials when requesting protected pages
   - Mention if there's a specific login flow

2. **Dynamic Content**
   - Let the agent know about interactive elements
   - Mention if specific tabs or sections need focus

3. **Performance**
   - Allow time for complex pages to load
   - Mention if certain elements need special attention

## Capabilities

The tool can:
- Handle single-page applications (SPAs)
- Navigate and capture multiple tabs
- Wait for dynamic content to load
- Capture specific elements
- Handle various authentication flows
- Analyze page structure
- Detect and interact with UI components

## Examples

1. **Basic Page Capture**

Can you capture https://app.example.com/dashboard?
Login credentials:
user: admin@example.com
pass: admin123
```

3. **Multi-Tab Interface**
```
Can you capture all tabs on https://app.example.com/settings?
Make sure to wait for each tab's content to load.
```

4. **Complex Data Views**
```
Can you capture the analytics dashboard at https://app.example.com/analytics?
Please ensure all charts are fully rendered.
```
